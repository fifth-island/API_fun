        <em>API selected: </em> &nbsp;

        </a>

      <br>
      <p> This API was located in the public library of 
        APIs on Github provided in the resources for 
        the assignment.<br><br>
        <em>Source: </em>&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis">https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis</a>

      <p>
        <em>API's description: </em>&nbsp;
        This API provides facts and pictures about random 
        animals. It is a public API where users can request 
        zoo animal data in JSON format.
        This API supports two possible endpoints. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-> The first returns a random animal and all its information 
        (name, latin name, animal type, active time, 
        length and weigth's ranges, lifespan, habitat, 
        diet, location, ID, and image).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-> The second endpoint returns a list of animal structs, 
        being able to return from 1 to 10 at the same time.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <em>API's options used: </em>&nbsp;
      The request focused just in the first endpoint.
      Every time the user click on the button, a new random
      animal is retrieved from the API database and displayed 
      in the screen. For this assigment, the elements used 
      were "name", "origin", and "image", which helped to 
      compose a descriptive introduction to the "rescued animals."
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <e>API's applicability: </e>&nbsp;
        This API could be user for didatic purposes.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-> It could be used for teaching children
        about ecology, animal names, and all diversity in the world.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-> It could be used as the database for some 
        virtual game. The possibilities of games to be made with this API
        are vast, considering that memory games, guess the animal, and several 
        other games realting to memory and general knowledge could use of this 
        API.

     <h3 class="h3-titles">Question</h3>
     <p style="text-align:center; font-size: 22px;">
      What were the most challenging and most satisfying things about doing this assignment?</p>
     <br>
     <p>The most challenging part was figuring out how to follow the AJAX/JSON protocols,
      since the example provided on CANVAS was not working properly. It took me a while to understand 
      the best approach for that. 
      <br>
      I also struggled a little bit for testing. I know Siteground provide the best way of 
      testing in the server-base side, but I found out a VisualCode extension that allows me to test those
      server-based features throughout my browser. It is called "Live Server". 
      <br>
      The most satisfying part of the assignment was understanding how powerful APIs can be 
      and knowing htat right now I am able to navigate and manage them (at least superficially) 
      shows me that I am learning a lot in this course.
